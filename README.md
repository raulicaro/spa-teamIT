SPA - Test Team.IT

This SPA was created as a Frontend Coding Challenge - React. It is an Interactive Web Application that interacts with a mocked API. I have implemented, in a simplified way, features like user authentication, data fetching, and dynamic rendering.

In this project, I use json-server so that the application can consume real data locally, simulating a real application with a backend. The `db.json` file (at the same level as `package.json`) stores the information, simulating a database.

To install json-server:

### `npm install -D json-server`

To run the API:

### `npm run server`

The API will be available at:

http://localhost:5000/items


To run the project:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
